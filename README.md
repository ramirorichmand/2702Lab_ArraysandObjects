# Exercise - Working with Arrays and Objects

In the start point there are three files (`arrays.js`, `objects.js`, and `advanced.js`) containing some exercises. For each exercise:

- If there is a variable declared (eg. `someVariable = null`) I replaced the `null` with the value being asked for.
- Uncommented the `console.log()` call to check my solution.
- Ran the file using Node.
- Re-commented the `console.log()` to make it easier to read the output of the next question.

looked up the documentation ([here for Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), [here for Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)), some will need both!

## MVP

- `arrays.js`
- `objects.js`

## Extensions

- `advanced.js`
